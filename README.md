# NetLogo ABM RLX queuing
ABM code for NetLogo upoaded by TC 7/10/2018

This model aims to reveal factors that can cause cars to queue on railway level crossings. Queuing occurs when one or more cars stop on the crossing for any length of time. Queuing has led to a small number of cases where trains have collided with cars.
The model used elements of the Traffic Basic model from the NetLogo library. This model retains code from the Traffic Basic model to keep cars separate and to adjust their speed to avoid colliding with the car in front. Cars attempt to maintain a minimum speed and avoid exceeding the speed limit.
Cars traverse the main road travelling either east or the west. At the mid-point they cross the railway level crossing (RLX). Some drivers will comply with the clearway signals to avoid stopping on the RLX, others will not. Some cars will turn right into the side-street downsteam of the RLX. Depending on teffic density, this may cause traffic jams to back up to the RLX.
